#Task 1: Leap Year Checker Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a year. The program should determine if the given year is a leap year or not and then display an appropriate message. Please note that this is the definition of a leap year: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

current_year = int(input("What year are we in now? "))

if current_year % 4 == 0 and current_year % 100 == 0 and current_year % 400 == 0:
    print("This is a leap year!")
elif current_year % 4 == 0 and current_year % 100 == 0:
    print("This is not a leap year.")
elif current_year % 4 == 0:
    print("This is a leap year!")
